          <p>Thank you for deciding to participate in the experiment.
          We are a research team at Masdar Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and we seek your participation in furthering our understanding of human behavior in games.
          <p>You can make a reasonable amount of money from this game depending on the decisions you make. You are therefore advised to read the following instructions carefully in order to make informed decisions throughout the course of the game. Your participation in this game will take approximately 30 minutes.
          <p>For your participation, you will be compensated with the task's standard reward of 1USD, as well as a significant bonus that depends on your performance in the experiment. These will be paid out at the end of the game, provided you follow all instructions, and play the game till the end.
          <p>You will complete 2 stages before starting the game itself. In the first stage, you will be provided with a walkthrough of the game via screenshots of the actual game interface along with the instructions for the game. In the second stage, you will be asked 2 comprehension questions to test your understanding of the game.
          <p><b>After passing the comprehension test, you will be matched with another human who will be your associate throughout the course of the game. </b>
          <p>Please confirm that you are willing to participate in good faith, using the following checkbox. If you are not willing to do so, please return the assignment.

           <p style='padding-left:5em'> 

            <input type='checkbox' id='confirmation'> I understand that this game requires my undivided attention for up to 30 minutes, and I am willing to commit said time and attention until the game comes to an end.

              <p> <b>YOUR ASSOCIATE</b>
          As a participant in this experiment, you will play a simple game with a human. The game will only be played once, each game consisting of a number of rounds. You are matched with the same person across all rounds of the game.

                          <p>
                          In each round of the game, you and your associate will be individually offered a choice between two actions, A or B. You submit your choice by clicking on the option that represents that choice. In any given round, you will not be able to see the choice of your associate until after you both submit your choices.
                          <div>

                          To help you make the right choices in the game, you will have the ability to chat with a Bot. This Bot is an intelligent algorithm that knows how to play the game very well, so you might want to listen to it. You are however free to decide when to ask for help and how often you do so. There are 3 possible questions that you can ask the Bot.
                          <div>
                            <img src="/images/tutorial/actionPhase.png" class='col-md-12' style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

                            </div>
                            <p>Question 1: What are my Options?
                            <p> Description of the answer: When you ask the Bot this question, it responds with a list of 2/3 possible “ways” you can play the game form the current round. Each option is a complete plan, stating the actions you should take, the actions expected of your associate, what you should do if your associate does not comply and why that option is good. It is best to follow the option for the specified number of rounds to get the maximum benefit. An example is shown in the screenshot below:
<p>Question 2: What should I do know?
<p>Description of the answer: When you ask the Bot this question, it tells you the specific action to pick in the present round. It also gives you a feedback about what happened in the previous round. For example, it tells you whether you followed its recommendation or not and whether your associate complied with his/her half of the plan. It also lets you know if you are doing great or you can do better!
<p>Question 3: Tell me about my associate?
<p>Description of the answer: If you would like to know specific details about your associate, this is the question to ask. It tells you on average how mean (does not cooperate) or cooperative, how lenient (willing to let you get away with a defection) and how forgiving (punishes a defection but willing to still cooperate afterwards) he/she has been.
Your conversation with the Bot will be available in a dialogue box throughout the game and you can freely scroll up or down to view your chat history.

                            <div id='page5' style='display:none'>
          At the end of the round, the points obtained by both of you will be highlighted for you to see. Your points in each round will depend on your choice and the choice of your opponent. This gives rise to the four possible scenarios as shown in the screenshot below. In each cell, the first number represents your points and second number represents the points of your associate. A history of your choices and points earned will also be available in the dialogue box below the game. The scenario below occurs when you choose A and the other player chooses B.

                              <p> <b> YOUR EARNINGS</b>
          Your accumulated earnings is obtained by summing your points over all rounds of the game thus far. These points are then converted to money by multiplying each point by $0.02.
